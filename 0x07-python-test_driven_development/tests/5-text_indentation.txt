============================================

This module defines a text-indentation function that takes a stream of
stringed datatype (``text``) and wherever it encounters the characters
[., ?, :], it wraps the next text to a new line.

Usage
==========================

Importing the function from the module:
::
    >>> text_indentation = __import__("5-text_indentation").text_indentation
    >>> text_indentation("Hello?It is me.")
    Hello?
    <BLANKLINE>
    It is me.
    <BLANKLINE>

Checking for module docstring:
::
    >>> str = __import__("5-text_indentation").__doc__
	>>> len(str) > 1
	True

No spaces are printed at the beginning of a line.
::
    >>> text_indentation("  Hello?It is me.")
    Hello?
    <BLANKLINE>
    It is me.
    <BLANKLINE>

When blank spaces are provided as the parameter, it prints nothing
::
    >>> text_indentation("       ")

White spaces after striped from both ends of the string
::
    >>> text_indentation("Hello?It is me.                ")
    Hello?
    <BLANKLINE>
    It is me.
    <BLANKLINE>

::
    >>> text_indentation("  Hello?It is me.    ")
    Hello?
    <BLANKLINE>
    It is me.
    <BLANKLINE>

::
    >>> text_indentation("  Hello?              It is me.         ")
    Hello?
    <BLANKLINE>
    It is me.
    <BLANKLINE>

Printing the new line character within a text

::
    >>> text_indentation("Hello: It is me.\nCan we start?We\ncan start from where we stopped\n.")
    Hello:
    <BLANKLINE>
    It is me.
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    Can we start?
    <BLANKLINE>
    We
    can start from where we stopped
    .
    <BLANKLINE>

Invalid Text
============

The parameter ``text`` must be a string. Otherwise, a TypeError is raised.

::
    >>> text_indentation(None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string

::
    >>> text_indentation(2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string

::
    >>> text_indentation(["test", "text"])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string
